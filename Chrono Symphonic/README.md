# Chrono Symphonic

This directory contains an unofficial mirror of the fan created Chrono Symphonic originally released in 2006. Most mirrors containing the album have since ceased to exist. This directory contains all 25 tracks of the original OST, as well as album covers and CD images. Each track has had the album artwork embedded into the mp3 tags so that it should be portable to any software you use for audio playback.

Please see http://chrono.ocremix.org/ for further information about this album.
